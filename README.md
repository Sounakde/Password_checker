# Password_checker
The Password checker project checks if the password that is given as input has ever been leaked or not in the past.
Based on output, the program will confirm if the password can be used for login or not.
The project accesses a real time database using 'Have I been pwned' website's api for information and checking of passwords.
Modifications can be done to improve the project and if you are not able to, then you can comment with the suggestion.
